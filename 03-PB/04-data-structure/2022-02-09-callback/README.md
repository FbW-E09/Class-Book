## Higher-order function
A higher-order function is a function that takes in input another function

## Callback
A callback is a function that we pass as an argument to another function

- functions are values
- since functions are values, we can assign them to other variables
- we can also pass them as arguments to other functions
- we can have calls to other functions, from inside a function
- callback: a function passed as argument to another function
