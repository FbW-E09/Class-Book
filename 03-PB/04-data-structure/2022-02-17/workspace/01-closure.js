/**
 * Closure
 *
 * - A closure is a function that has access to its surrounding scope
 * - we can have a function (outer function) that returns a new function (inner function) and the inner function
 * has ALWAYS access to whatever was inside of outer function (its scope)
 *
 * - A closure is a function having access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has closed.
 *
 * - A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed)
 * with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment).
 * In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function.
