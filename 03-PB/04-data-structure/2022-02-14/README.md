# Advanced Array Methods Review

Arrays have some nice built-in methods, such as:

## forEach

the `forEach` method is syntactic sugar for the for loop. It also does not modify the original array, but it does **not** return any value back.

## map

We can use `map` to transform each item in an array. The `map` method will return us a new array (without modifying the original array).

## filter

The filter method cleans up the array, we can remove certain items easily. It will also return an array and it does not modify the original array.

## reduce

The reduce method iterates over each item in an array and returns one value - an accumulation from all the iterations. This one value can be of different types: it can be a number, a string, an object.
