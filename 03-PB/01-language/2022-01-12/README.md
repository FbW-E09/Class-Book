Recap:
- data types
- declaring a variable
- differences between `var`, `let` and `const`
- variable naming conventions
- naming boolean variables
- console.log()
 
Statements:
- statements and expressions
- Hello world: `console.log(<expression>)`
- Comments: `//`, `/* */`
- unclosed parentheses syntax error
- comma and + in console.log()

Expressions and operators
- String expressions: single quotes, double quotes, concatenation
- Mathematical expressions: +, -, *, /, %
- Boolean expressions: comparison operators (===, !==, >=, <=, >, <)
- Conditional expressions: the ternary operator (combining the examples above)

Changing variables:
- Variable reassignment: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, string accumulation
- increment operator `++`, `--`
- conditional assignment with the ternary operator
- Reassigning constants

String:
- Escaping special chars: `\'`, `\""`, `\n`
- common problems with strings and quotes
- String interpolation: template literals, using expressions within strings
- Getting the length of a string: `String.prototype.length`
- Getting a character in a string: bracket notation

- Implicit and explicit coersion
