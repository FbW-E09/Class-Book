## Overview

Functions are the building blocks of big applications, understanding how to reuse common pieces of logic is a necessary fundamental. In this sub module, we will dive deep into the world of functions and get their hands dirty with more complex logical problems.

### Objectives

By the end of this sub module, we will be able to:

- Identify when a function is being used with and without arguments
- Declare functions in JavaScript and explain when functions should be created
- Understand how a program with functions is read by a computer and explain the term call stack
- Differentiate between function arguments and function parameters
- Understand the definition of side effects, and compare between functions with side effects and pure functions
- Understand the definition of recursive functions and their uses
