    <h1>Yugoslav monitor Drava</h1>

    <p>
      Yugoslav Navy between 1921 and 1941. She was originally built for the
      Austro-Hungarian Navy as the name ship of the Enns-class river monitors.
      As SMS Enns, she was part of the Danube Flotilla during World War I, and
      fought against the Serbian and Romanian armies from Belgrade to the lower
      Danube. In October 1915, she was covering an amphibious assault on
      Belgrade when she was holed below the waterline by a direct hit, and had
      to be towed to Budapest for repairs. After brief service with the
      Hungarian People's Republic at the end of the war, she was transferred to
      the newly created Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later
      Yugoslavia), and renamed Drava. She remained in service throughout the
      interwar period, but was not always in full commission due to budget
      restrictions.

    <h2>Description and construction</h2>
    <p>
      SMS Enns was constructed for the Austro-Hungarian Navy as the name ship of
      the Enns-class river monitors by Schiffswerft Linz and Stabilimento
      Tecnico Triestino (STT). She was laid down by Schiffswerft Linz at Linz on
      21 November 1913,[1] as part of the Austro-Hungarian 1912 Naval
      Program.[2] She was named after the River Enns, a tributary of the Danube.
      When World War I broke out in July 1914, construction of Enns was well
      advanced, but after Schiffswerft Linz was taken over by STT, her machinery
      was ordered from the STT works near Trieste. On 2 August, the machinery
      was dispatched by train to Linz and installation began without delay.[1]
      She was launched in September 1914, and completed on 17 October of that
      year.[3] Despite the requirement that Enns and SMS Inn be constructed as
      sister ships, and the fact that their size and armament were identical,
      there were significant design differences between the two vessels, as they
      were constructed by completely independent shipbuilding companies. Enns
      had an overall length of 60.2 m (197 ft 6 in),[a] a beam of 10.3 m (33 ft
      10 in), and a normal draught of 1.3 m (4 ft 3 in). Her standard
      displacement was 536 tonnes (528 long tons), and her crew consisted of 95
      officers and enlisted men.[5] She had two triple-expansion steam engines,
      each driving a single propeller shaft. Steam for the engines was provided
      by two Yarrow water-tube boilers,[1] and her engines were rated at 1,500
      indicated horsepower (1,100 kW), with a maximum of 1,700 ihp (1,300 kW).
      She was designed to reach a top speed of 13 knots (24 km/h; 15 mph),[4]
      and carried 70 tonnes (69 long tons) of fuel oil.[2]

      Enns was armed with one twin gun turret of 120 mm (4.7 in)L/45[b] guns
      mounted forward, and three single 120 mm (4.7 in) L/10 howitzer turrets
      mounted on the aft deck. On the upper deck there were two single 66 mm
      (2.6 in) L/50 anti-aircraft guns, one on the port side forward of the
      funnel, and one on the starboard side to the rear of the funnel. She was
      also equipped with six 8 mm (0.31 in) machine guns.[6] The maximum range
      of her Å koda 120 mm (4.7 in) L/45 guns was 15 km (9.3 mi), and her
      howitzers could fire their 20 kg (44 lb) shells a maximum of 6.2
      kilometres (3.9 mi).[7] Her armour consisted of belt and bulkheads 40 mm
      (1.6 in) thick and deck armour 25 mm (0.98 in) thick, and her conning
      tower and gun turrets were 50 mm (2.0 in) thick.[3]
