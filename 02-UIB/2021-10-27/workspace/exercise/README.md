# Box sizing

There are 8 `div` elements in the page.

The `div`s are divided in 2 sections:
- a `content-box` section
- a `border-box` section

- The `div` in the first section have `box-sizing: content-box;`.
- The `div` in the first section have `box-sizing: border-box;`.

Each `div` should have 
- 16px `padding` on all sides
- a 5px `border` on all sides

Your goal is to make the `div`s in both sections to have respectively a final size of:

- 100px the first div
- 150px the second div
- 200px the third div
- 250px the fourth div

Complete the style for each `div` so that they all look the same in the end
